- Duplication across CSS files

### After Improvements
- 0 inline styles (all replaced with utility classes)
- Consistent component styling across all pages
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant accessibility features
- Streamlined CSS with modular file structure
- Complete design system documentation
- Enhanced visual appeal with subtle animations and effects
- Improved interactivity with responsive feedback
- Cross-browser compatible styles with vendor prefixes

## Future Recommendations

1. **Component Library**
   - Consider building a JavaScript component library for interactive elements
   - Create standardized UI patterns for more complex interactions

2. **CSS Architecture**
   - Explore CSS modules or CSS-in-JS for more complex component isolation
   - Consider build tools to optimize CSS delivery

3. **Design System Evolution**
   - Regular review of design tokens and component usage
   - User testing to validate accessibility improvements
   - Version control for design system updates
   - Further enhancement of animation effects and interactions

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Critical CSS extraction for above-the-fold content
   - Lazy-loading of non-critical styles
   - Further reduction of unused CSS
   - Optimization of animations for low-power devices
   - Enhanced browser caching strategies

5. **Expanded Documentation**
   - Interactive component examples
   - Animation guidelines (now available in CSS-ENHANCEMENT-GUIDE.md)
   - Page layout templates
   - Cross-browser compatibility documentation
   - Mobile-specific optimizations
